How our project should run:
Right now our prototype will prompt the user to select a story they want to either input a certain amount of adjectives, verbs, past tense verbs, and nouns as a comma seperated list or have the computer randomly generate a story. The amount of each needed is determined by a counter that counts each item in our story, so the person will only need to fill in each list themselves. Our program should then output a story that has their adjectives, verbs, past tense verbs, and nouns. Main.py imports stories.py, where it selects the story from and random_words.py where randomly generated words can be found.
We download a color text package, colored 1.4.1, to add color to our stories and drawings from drawing.py
